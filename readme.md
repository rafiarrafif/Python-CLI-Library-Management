> _"A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life."_ - Henry Ward Beecher

A minimalist command-line library management system built with Python. Yes, it's simple. No, it won't make you coffee. But hey, it manages books! 📖

## 🎯 What's This About?

This is a super straightforward library management system I built for my Programming Fundamentals practicum assignment. Think of it as a library system that decided to go on a minimalist retreat and came back with only the essentials.

**What it does:**

- ✅ Add books (because what's a library without books?)
- ✅ View book list (to see what treasures we have)
- ✅ Borrow books (the whole point, really)

**What it doesn't do:**

- ❌ Judge your reading choices
- ❌ Remind you to return books (be responsible, please!)
- ❌ Make coffee (sadly)

## ✨ Features

Let's not oversell this. Here's what you get:

- **Add Books** - Add new books to your collection. ISBN? Nah. Categories? Nope. Just the basics: title, author, and year. Keep it simple!
- **View Books** - See all the books chilling in your library. It's like window shopping, but for books.
- **Borrow Books** - Take a book out. That's it. No library card, no late fees, no judgmental librarians.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+ (because we're living in the future)
- CLI (fancy term for "runs in your terminal")

## 📦 Installation

Don't worry, this is easier than assembling IKEA furniture.

### What You'll Need

- Python 3.11 or newer (check with `python3 --version`)
- pip (it probably came with Python, so you're good)
- Basic ability to use a terminal (you got this!)

### Let's Get Started

1.  **Grab the code:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafiarrafif/library-system-cli.git
cd library-system-cli
```

2.  **Install the magic ingredients:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it! See? Told you it was easy. 🎉

## 🚀 Running the App

Ready to manage some books? Here we go:

```bash
python3 code.py
```

Boom! 💥 You're now a library manager. Congratulations on your new unpaid position.

## 📖 How to Use This Thing

Once you run the app, you'll see a menu that looks something like this:

```

|                                          |
|             Sistem Pinjam Buku           |
|                                          |

+------------------------------------------+

=== Menu Utama ===
a) Tambah Buku
b) Tampilkan Buku
c) Pinjam Buku
d) keluar

Pilih:
```

### Adding a Book

Pick option `a`, answer some questions about the book, and voilà! You're now a librarian.

```
Masukan judul buku: Laskar Pelangi
Masukan penulis buku: Andrea Hirata
Masukan ISBN buku: 9793062797
Masukan stock (kosongkan jika tidak ada): 12
Buku Laskar Pelangi berhasil ditambahkan.
```

### Viewing Books

Pick option `b` and admire your growing collection. It's like a museum, but you can actually touch stuff.

### Borrowing a Book

Pick option `c`, choose a book, and it's yours! (Not really, you have to give it back eventually. That's how libraries work.)

## 📁 Project Structure

├── requirements.txt     # Fancy dependencies (if any)
└── README.md            # You are here! 👈
```

Keep it simple, keep it clean, like a good haiku.

## 🐛 Known Issues

None yet! But I'm sure they're hiding somewhere, waiting to surprise us at 3 AM before the deadline.

If you find any bugs, please let me know. They're probably just shy features in disguise. 🦋

## 🔮 Future Plans

Because why stop at minimalism? Here are some ideas:

- [ ] User authentication (who borrowed what?)
- [ ] Search functionality (find books faster than using Ctrl+F)
- [ ] Due dates (with gentle reminders, not scary ones)
- [ ] Persistent storage (so books don't vanish when you close the app)
- [ ] Book ratings (because we all judge books)
- [ ] Late fees calculator (the fun police feature)
- [ ] Coffee maker integration (a developer can dream!)
